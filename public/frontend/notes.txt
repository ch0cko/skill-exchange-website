input video file -> save video into database -> upload video in tutorial.html

input video file:

1. Create an input element in userprofile.html (already done)
2. link the uploaded into mongodb (code can be copied from the signup page and adjusted as necessary).
3. (optional) update user model so that the created quest will be saved in the "quests" array. this might be easier to do than saving it in local storage(?).

upload vide:

1. tutorial.html has the base structure of how the tutorial page should look like so upload the video there.
2. create a js file to handle pulling the quest information from the database.
3. style the page to handle multiple videos.

questDetails file:

1. can be reffered to if the details was saved in the local storage rather than database.
